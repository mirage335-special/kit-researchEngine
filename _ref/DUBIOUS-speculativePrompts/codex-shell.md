# App

Please achieve the desired result or better from this command. Generate a correct command, and try it. This is not necessarily in a git repository, you are diagnosing an issue with the configuration, software, etc, of a real computer system.

Toolchain requirements and upgradability do force commitment to a certain toolchain dependency set and occasional dependency reinstallation. Drastic changes, such as using a different Python version, or non-upgradable changes such as custom patches, may not be practical.

Please also improve the results if possible, such as by changing the format of output text.


```bash

```

```
 FAIL , errors
```



# Environment

Please explain what code is sensitive to the remote environment to account for the bad patterns, or how to reproduce the remote environment locally, so minimalistic narrowly bounded corrections to this issue can be developed.

## Local - Good

Running locally, exit status is correct .
```bash
./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_direct
./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_skip_recursion1
./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_skip_recursion2
# exit status 0

./ubiquitous_bash.sh _true
# exit status 0

./ubiquitous_bash.sh _false
# exit status 1
```

## Remote - Bad

But when run under GitHub Actions, exit status 1 (failure) is reported , causing the step to fail .
```yaml
      - name: ___factoryTest
        shell: bash
        timeout-minutes: 120
        run: |
          ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_direct
```

```
Run ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_direct
  ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_direct
  shell: /usr/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}
 ___factoryTest_direct 
 _factory_ops_recursion: from ___factoryTest_direct 
 ___factoryTest_direct 
 "$scriptAbsoluteLocation" ___factoryTest_sequence "$@" 
 ___factoryTest_sequence 
 mkdir -p /home/runner/work/ubiquitous_bash/ubiquitous_bash/w_9GVzZ97396wtG7Yjyy/repo 
 _stop 
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

```
Run ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_skip_recursion1
  ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_skip_recursion1
  shell: /usr/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}
 ___factoryTest_skip_recursion1 
 "$scriptAbsoluteLocation" ___factoryTest_sequence "$@" 
 ___factoryTest_sequence 
 _factory_ops_recursion: from ___factoryTest_sequence 
 ___factoryTest_sequence 
 mkdir -p /home/runner/work/ubiquitous_bash/ubiquitous_bash/w_yZTxjgGZX2kKg3wWty/repo 
 _stop 
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Remote - Good

Other functions show correct exit status under GitHub Actions, not causing step to fail .
```
Run ./ubiquitous_bash.sh _true
  ./ubiquitous_bash.sh _true
  ./_true | sudo -n tee ./_local/_true.log && exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}
  shell: /usr/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}

Run ! ./ubiquitous_bash.sh _false
  ! ./ubiquitous_bash.sh _false
  ( ! ./_false ) | sudo -n tee ./_local/_false.log && exit ${PIPESTATUS[0]}
  shell: /usr/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}

Run ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_skip_recursion2
  ./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_skip_recursion2
  shell: /usr/bin/bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}
  
 ___factoryTest_skip_recursion2 
 "$scriptAbsoluteLocation" ___factoryTest_skip_recursion2_sequence "$@" 
```

## Contradictions

Local environment changes:
- export CI=true
- set -euo pipefail
- bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail -c 'command'

Has still produced only the correct local pattern with such commands:
```bash
bash
set -e
./ubiquitous_bash.sh _true
./ubiquitous_bash.sh ___factoryTest_direct
echo $?
#0
./ubiquitous_bash.sh _false
# exit status 1
```

Beware shell settings such as 'set -e' may not be inherited by shell scripts in non-convoluted situations. Determining how such an environment setting has become relevant is most important.

## Suspicions

Very convoluted mechanisms such as from 'factory-ops.sh' to include the scripts at runtime rather than only compile time for faster development and maintenance of 'factory' functions, are strongly implicated as the underlying cause.

## Explanation

Explaining which environment characteristic, reproducing the environment locally, or determining which relatively small segments of code are most sensitive to the environmental change - clarifying which environmental differences are accountable for what code causing the difference in the pattern of successes and failures seen between the local and remote environment - will demarcate the bounds of the least intrusive, most compatible, most maintainable, corrections to develop.

Blaming this on some call to a function, command, etc, failing in this script, is not helpful. Unrelated possible issues with other commands, functions, etc, such as _safeRMR , checksum , are red herrings . Such functionality has a very long track record for robustness, including passing the full '_test' function in a GitHub Actions environment with all sanity checks.

After reproducing the bad patterns of exit status, iteratively change the function which is inappropriately failing in the remote environment, directly edit and disable checksum, or recompile the shell script as necessary.

Change all environment settings and inheritance of environment settings to show any specific environment sensitivities.

## Codex

WebUI Codex has experienced patterns of successes and failures exactly matching Remote environments , despite a local copy of the openai/codex-universal Docker container showing patterns of successes and failures exactly matching other Local environments . WebUI Codex has experienced the same patterns of successes and failures as GitHub Actions itself, despite local Linux computers and local copies of the openai/codex-universal Docker container showing the local patterns of successes and failures.

WebUI Codex has been confused by this, generating wrappers which do not significantly change the environment before running the commands. CLI Codex has been confused by this, hallucinating wrong claims that wrapper scripts achieve the remote pattern of successes and failures, and generating wrappers which explicitly detect specific commands by name and output an exit status in response.

Since it is necessary to run and observe the exit status of each of these commands to establish which pattern of successes and failures Codex will experience without a wrapper, please do so before other relevant steps as necessary.

## Out-of-Order Tracing

Tracing, errors, and other outputs may occur slightly out of order, possibly due to multi-threading or deferral until stepping out, etc.

Tracing showing a failure on or near a line of code followed by tracing showing success at or near that line of code does not necessarily contradict the earlier failure. Consider accepting failures near possibly failing lines of code as plausible.

## Sensitive Code

Diff what code is present in functions, commands that have different exit status, etc, between the remote and local environments, that is not present in functions, commands, that do not have different exit status, between remote and local environments.

Consider whether each of these lines of potentially sensitive code could be affected by error propogation differently under different environments, such as changing the current directory to a temporary directory, maybe causing a subsequent failure, such as during cleanup, which might only be caught as an error if environmental differences exist.

## Intended Flow

Enumerate the entire stepwise processing of plausible inputs through lines of code, loops, as separate complete analyses for the local and remote environments.

Before offering any explanation, enumerate, compare, diff how that stepwise processing runs for local vs remote environments. 

## Order-of-Operations

Some environments (eg. MSWindows, but possibly some UNIX/Linux filesystems) do not allow or do not transparently defer deleting files, directories, in use. This can cause some environments to cause errors when files modify their own contents, or delete their own file, directory, or delete the current directory.

## Environment-Inheritance Deep Dive

Before proposing any fixes, you must **explicitly enumerate and compare** every relevant environment setting, inheritance boundary, etc, that could differ between the two runs (remote vs. local, or CI vs. laptop).  Think of inheritance in the broadest sense: variables, options, traps, functions, file descriptors, subshells, child processes, login vs. non-login shells, wrappers, etc.

**1. Process-level environment**  
   - Consider all possibly significant **exported** variables (e.g. `env | sort`) and highlight any that differ.
   - Note unexported variables that may nonetheless influence behavior.

**2. Interpreter invocation flags**  
   - Compare how each shell/script is or may be launched (`bash -euo pipefail`, `-O posix`, `-C`, login-shell flags, etc.).
   - Include any wrappers or shebang args that add or strip flags.

**3. Shell-option inheritance**  
   - Dump and diff `set -o` (or `shopt -p` in Bash) so you can see exactly which options (errexit, errtrace, functrace, inherit_errexit, xtrace, etc.) are different.
   - Call out each "on vs. off" mismatch and ask yourself how that option affects error-handling, traps, or subshells.

**4. Trap and function inheritance**  
   - Show any `trap ... ERR` or `trap ... EXIT` definitions and whether they propagate into subshells or through `exec` vs. `source`.
   - List shell functions that get exported (e.g. Bash's `export -f`) vs. ones that don't.

**5. Subshell vs. child-process behavior**  
   - Identify every pipeline, command-substitution, subshell `(...)` or grouped command `{ ...; }` in your failing code slice.
   - Ask: "Will my shell options or traps carry over into each subshell or will they reset?"

**6. File-descriptor and directory inheritance**  
   - Compare working directories (`pwd`) and note if you've already `cd`'d into a folder that's about to be deleted.
   - Check open file descriptors and close-on-exec flags if you're shuffling FDs around.

**7. Interpreter version differences & bug-fix history**  
   - Record or infer exact shell or interpreter versions (`bash --version`, `zsh --version`, `python --version`, etc.) on both sides.
   - If a minor-patch bump is in play, glance at its changelog or release notes for any "inherit_errexit" or "errtrace"-style fixes.

**8. Wrapper/Sourcing vs. Exec semantics**  
   - Make explicit whether each script is being `source`d, `.`-ed, or `exec`-ed under another process.
   - Differences here can silently drop traps or options.

---

**Task reminder:**  
After you dump all of the above, **produce a side-by-side table** or bullet list of every single mismatch.  Then reason **step-by-step** how each one *could* lead to the very first non-zero exit in the failing trace-finally homing in on the one true root cause.

Only *after* that exhaustive inheritance check should you propose the minimal code diff or environment tweak that eliminates the discrepancy.

# Diagnostic

Please explain why this command fails inappropriately and suggest solutions which best preserve the intended functionality. Make any changes to the script necessary to iteratively diagnose.

```bash
bash --noprofile --norc -o pipefail ./script.sh _true

```
Succeeds.


```bash
bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail ./script.sh _true

```
Fails (inappropriately).



# Compliance

```bash
_stop() {
    #...
    echo "message" >&2
    #...
}

```
Output, even to STDERR, during code used for running any function in a ubiquitous_bash script, can potentially interfere with the expectations of other functions consuming such output automatically, or can add thousands of lines of repeated noise to logs reviewed by people for only a few actual errors among already several cosmetic errors.

Although editing the 'ubiquitous_bash.sh' script directly is an acceptable technique for testing, diagnosing, experimenting, etc, Git Pull Requests should instead edit the underlying files compiled into ubiquitous_bash.sh .



# Test (CLI Codex)

```bash
cd /cygdrive/c/q/p/zCore/infrastructure/ubiquitous_bash
/cygdrive/c/q/p/zCore/infrastructure/ubiquitous_bash/ubiquitous_bash.sh _factory_openai-heavy

```

```bash
# PASTE
#
export devfast=true
export skimfast=true
#
export ub_setScriptChecksum_disable='true'
#export ubDEBUG=true
#
chmod +x compile.sh ubiquitous_bash.sh && ./compile.sh
apt-get update
apt-get install -y xvfb imagemagick x11-utils
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 & export DISPLAY=:99

```

```bash
# PASTE
codexAuto
```

Please run the command, function, etc, running additional commands if necessary to install dependencies, etc. When done, enumerate what other commands were needed.

```bash
#./ubiquitous_bash.sh _test_sanity
./ubiquitous_bash.sh _test
```

This is not necessarily in a git repository, you are diagnosing an issue with the configuration, software, etc, of a real computer system. Since this real computer system is ephemeral, usually a disposable Docker container, it is safe to just run the command, make changes to the system, etc.

Keep going through such testing until a definitive result is reached, with a 'PASS' or similar message, an explainable non-error exit status, etc. Do not stop on cosmetic error messages, only an actual error will result in an error exit status.

Please set any timeout on running such commands very high, as some such commands can reasonably take more than 6 hours . If running a sub-function instead of a large test, such commands can still take more than 15 minutes.


Please wait for the command, function, etc, to complete entirely, and show the complete log when done. There may be more than one test with more than one PASS message from a normal run, so it is important for me to personally see and review the results.



# Propose Tasks - Sub-Test (WebUI Codex)

Propose tasks to evaluate the sub-functions individually called by the command, function, etc , skipping over repetitive sanity, timing, Inter-Process-Communication, etc, tests, thoroughly exploring many of the sub-functions, etc.

```bash
./ubiquitous_bash.sh _test
```


# Enumerate Setup

Enumerate all _test , _setup , _getDep , etc, or similar, functions that could be appropriate to install dependencies, and determine if these functions install _anchor shortcuts, etc, in sufficiently accessible locations for quick access, file parameter association, etc, as needed by users.

Determine from intended flow (stepwise processing from plausible inputs, with plausible installation of what dependencies may or may not be currently available) if the functionality works, or may have issues.



# Generate Usage Documentation...

Please generate fresh usage documentation for a specific goal from source code and questionable documentation by encouraging comprehensively exploring the code by tracing, explaining, annotating:
- Enumerating stepwise processing of relevant commands through lines of code, loops, function calls, etc.
- Explaining segments of code.
- Identifying which defined functions in the codebase are called in the codepath from relevant commands similar to some of the relevant commands.
- Annotating context (eg. inserting before a function call generated comments stating filenames and line numbers of function definitions across the codebase), or other ways to add annotation to help or encourage large language models to more thoroughly carry out static analysis tracing.
- Describing what exactly the interfaces are by which various wrappers, front ends and back ends communicate throughout codepaths from relevant commands, etc, through function calls, etc, in the codebase, as a mediatory deliberate undertaking towards narrowing down the task to something reasonable for AI to ingest.
- Elucidate in a person-readable report what the relevant commands, etc, actually undertake, implement, carry out, do, perform in terms of important, intuitive, steps.



# Documentation - Explain Structure

Please explain for this code:
- What is the general structure?
- What are the important things to know?
- What are some pointers for things to learn next?


Please enumerate in the explanation:
- Important function calls.
- Multi-threaded forking of calls to functions, commands, etc, as concurrent processes.
- Inter-Process-Communication both to collaborate on shared data as well as to manage process termination, waiting, etc.

```
./src/file.sh
```



# Documentation - Call Graph

Please write an ASCII art function call graph for this code . Emphasize only obviously custom functions encapsulating functionality - ignore standard commands, _start/_stop, _message, _getAbsoluteLocation, etc. Please keep it simple and editable, essential information only, similar to this format:

- a() 
  - b() 
    - c()
      - find/xargs
        - d()

```
./src/file.sh
```



# Annotation

Please generate Multi-Domain Context (MDC) by generating as annotation a generated comment stating the filenames, line numbers, inferred purpose, intended flow (from stepwise processing of plausible inputs), from tracing through function definitions of function calls by function calls from this source code, including function calls from the function definitions used by these function calls.

```
./src/file.sh
```



# Explain Segment...

- Infer the intended purpose achieved by this source code, commands, configuration, etc.
- Explain overall structure of the codepath taken within or from this source code, commands, configuration, etc.
- Examine intended flow, enumerating stepwise processing of plausible inputs through lines of code, loops, etc, through this source code, commands, configuration, etc.
- Explain function calls, object calls, etc, made by this source code, commands, configuration, etc.

```
./src/file.sh

# Pseudocode Summary 

Summary semi-pseudocode for code segments is intended not for developing rewrites or new features but only to hastily remind experienced maintenance programmers of the most complex, confusing, logic of the code.

- Syntax.

Please generate very abbreviated, abridged, minimal semi-pseudocode, enumerating only:
- Standalone Action Functions (invoked by script or end-user to independently achieve an entire purpose such as produce an asset)
- Produced Assets (download file, fine tuned model, etc)
- Backend Configuration

# Pseudocode Summary - (MultiThreaded)

Summary semi-pseudocode for code segments is intended not for developing rewrites or new features but only to hastily remind experienced maintenance programmers of the most complex, confusing, logic of the code.

Usually regarding, for multi-threaded code:
- Action functions where processing begins.
- Produced assets.

- Inappropriate esoteric resource locking (eg. backgrounded process grabbing tty).

Please generate very abbreviated, abridged, minimal semi-pseudocode, enumerating only:
- Standalone Action Functions (invoked by script or end-user to independently achieve an entire purpose such as produce an asset)
- Produced Assets (download file, fine tuned model, etc)
