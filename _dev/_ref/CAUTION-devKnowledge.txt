CAUTION: Knowledge (ie. datasets, documentation) consolidated for development purposes, may be factually and logically very wrong, may include deprecated or broken code, etc, and thus must NEVER be used for fine-tuning LLMs, especially not at the beginning or end of training, etc, if there is any possibility of strongly influencing AI model output.


Some examples:

NVIDIA documentation may broadly refer to LLMs as 'compute bound', without specifying the arguably very unusual conditions under which this may be the case.
