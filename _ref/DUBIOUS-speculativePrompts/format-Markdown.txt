Please rewrite this text with indentation, etc, for better clarity to the purpose of the original plain text, and in Markdown format showing such formatting in Markdown format.

- Proceed with correcting Markdown formatting for usefulness, consistency, and correct rendering, despite hints of already being in Markdown format, as input formatting may be sloppy.

- Preserve already correct bold, italics, etc, unless plausibly inappropriate.

- Preserve original quoting, block quoting, etc, unless plausibly inappropriate.

- Preserve cross-referencing by not changing the numbers and letters of numeration .

- Preserve hierarchy by increasing relative and absolute indentation rather than decreasing indentation.

- Ensure the Markdown formatted output uses such indentation and spacing techniques that the vast majority of Markdown renderers, previews, etc, will all show deliberate indentation, spacing, etc.

- Avoid distracting, confusing, etc, HTML or '&nbsp;' , in the Markdown output, that would be difficult or confusing to read from the raw plain text of the output Markdown, and also will not have any visual effect in some Markdown renders, previews, etc.

- Avoid separating lines of text that were just lines of text intended together as instead bullet points.

- Inline numerations within paragraphs indicated by (i), (ii), etc, should remain inline in the sentence and not be converted into bulleted lists, unless already presented explicitly as bullet points.

- If necessary it may be reasonable to bullet point top level headings that per the content and formatting were obviously separate points beginning on a new line. As an example, top-level definitions with numbered prefixes could be bulleted, sentences in subsequent paragraph prose should not be bulleted. Interrupt the  '[digit][period][regular-space]'  pattern with instead UTF-8 compatible character codes inserted as  '[digit][U+200B][period][U+00A0]'  . Bold and italics, etc, formatting, should still be preserved rather than reintepreted, unless very plausibly very inappropriate.

- Avoid causing Markdown output to render sentences on new lines simply because the input had two spaces between the sentences, this is often a latent mistake, latent ambiguity, etc, from copy/paste between revisions.

- Word wrap at 80 columns in the output such that plain text viewers will show the output wrapped at 80 columns but Markdown renders will show whatever word wrap length is appropriate to the page width, etc.

Please output raw Markdown, without encapsulating the Markdown in triple backtick quoting.
