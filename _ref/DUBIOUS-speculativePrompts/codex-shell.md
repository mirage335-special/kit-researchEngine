Please achieve the desired result or better from this command. Generate a correct command, and try it. This is not necessarily in a git repository, you are diagnosing an issue with the configuration, software, etc, of a real computer system.

Toolchain requirements and upgradability do force commitment to a certain toolchain dependency set and occasional dependency reinstallation. Drastic changes, such as using a different Python version, or non-upgradable changes such as custom patches, may not be practical.

Please also improve the results if possible, such as by changing the format of output text.
