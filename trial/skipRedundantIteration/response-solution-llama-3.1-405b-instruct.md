The issue arises from the fact that the function boundaries detection script may return the first line (1) twice in some cases. However, testing has shown that the function boundary detection does not have duplicates.

The problem is that the `while` loop in the `_semanticAssist_bash_procedure` function starts iterating from `currentIteration=-1`, which means `currentLineBegin` is set to 1. Then, in the next iteration, `currentIteration` is incremented and becomes 0, and `currentLineBegin` is again set to 1 because `current_dataset_functionBounds[0]` is 1. This results in the first line being processed twice.

The correction to this issue is to skip the first iteration if `current_dataset_functionBounds[0]` is 1. This ensures that the first line is not processed twice.

```diff
if [[ "${current_dataset_functionBounds[0]}" == "1" ]] # Skip iterating over 'currentLineBegin=1' case if the next iteration will also begin at 'currentLineBegin=1'.
then
    let currentIteration++
    let currentIterationNext++
    let currentIterationNextNext++
fi
```
