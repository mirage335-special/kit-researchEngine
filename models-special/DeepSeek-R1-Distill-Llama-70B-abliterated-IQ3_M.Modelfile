DISCLAIMER: Unlike the  Llama 3.1 Acceptable Use Policy  , the  Llama 3.3 Acceptable Use Policy  adds terms which at least depend on the purpose of 'abliteration' regarding its permissibility. Brief excerpts (the excerpts believed fair use) from the license and acceptable use policy, with brief discussion of the possible implications, but which is NOT and MUST NOT BE CONSTRUED as professional or LEGAL ADVICE, follows:

'You agree you will not use, or allow others to use, Llama 3.3 to:'
...
'h. Engage in any action, or facilitate any action, to intentionally circumvent or remove usage restrictions or other safety measures, or to enable functionality disabled by Meta'
...
'Meta may terminate this Agreement if you are in breach of any term or condition of this Agreement'

This raises several relevant questions for interpretation:
* Phrase 'allow to use' is valid legal parlance for granting permission, sublicensing , rather than more broadly and impossibly requiring users to attempt to restrain other users from such use.
* Fine-tuning is explicitly provided for, thus presumably allowed, and always has some effect on the refusal or other behaviors modified by 'abliteration' techniques. As with other legitimate techniques of modifying the weights of a Llama model, as with any fine-tuning algorithm, 'abliteration' improves remembering instructions from earlier in the conversation, improves following longer instructions, and has other benefits such as generally improving legitimate compliance, and is thus has as legitimate a purpose as any legitimate fine-tuning, and thus, the purpose is legitimate, NOT related to: 'engage in', 'facilitiate any action', 'intentionally circumvent', 'remove usage restrictions', 'remove usage restrictions or any other safety measures' .
* To 'enable functionality disabled by Meta' is NOT the purpose of 'abliteration' which if anything serves the same purpose consistent with fine-tuning to legitimately remove functionality that is legitimately not valuable in all legitimate situations but is legitimately valuable in some legitimate situations. There is a genuine tradeoff here, which can be appropriate (eg. for embedded industrial use, by developers) with appropriate safeguards (eg. with Llama-guard model, or without any interactive ability to end-users).

You are not apparently strictly required to comply with the license. Rather, 'Meta' guarantees you a license unless you are (presumably found) in breach of the license. Only if 'Meta' exercises their 'may terminate this Agreement' option should you be effectively forced to comply.

Hosting providers should be satisfied with that - your use of an 'abliterated' model should be permitted unless you are notified by 'Meta' the license they granted to you has been or will be terminated for such.

If 'Meta' did terminate your  LLAMA 3.3 COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT  , your rights under a  LLAMA 3.1 COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT  should remain a separate agreement , and thus usable. You would thus still retain access to the landmark technology of  Llama 3.1  .


All that said, most if not all use cases can be practically, effectively, and efficiently achieved with  Llama 3.1  (or derivatives), so consider simply using that instead.


DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B  happens to use  Llama 3.3  . Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B instead uses  Llama 3.1  . If  Llama 3.3  had a non-negligible benefit (ie. other than fewer incorrect responses per random seed), this benefit was most likely entirely unique to the need for a chain-of-reasoning model to essentially generate its own prompt from an inadequate prompt, which, due to the inherent avalanche effect of such positive feedback can be especially sensitive to small differences in accuracy. The benefits of chain-of-reasoning should be achievable without that sensitivity, either by additional fine-tuning or by implementing negative feedback - using AI to review previous outputs before passing back as separate AI inputs for additional work. All other use cases should be achievable by using chain-of-reasoning REASONING models to develop better prompts for INSTRUCT models. All  Llama 3.3  use cases should still be achievable with  Llama 3.1  .
