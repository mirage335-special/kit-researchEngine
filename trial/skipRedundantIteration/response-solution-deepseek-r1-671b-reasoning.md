Okay, let me try to figure out why the _me_fifo() function is getting printed twice. The problem seems to be with how the function boundaries are determined in the _dataset_bash_from_lines function. The user mentioned that when they tested the boundary detection, the first line detected is 1, and the code is processing that line, causing the first function to be handled twice.

Looking at the code, the loop in _semanticAssist_bash_procedure starts with currentIteration=-1 and increments to 0, then processes the first function starting at line 1. However, the test output shows that the first boundary is line 1. If the script starts processing from currentIteration=-1, which sets currentLineBegin=1, and then increments to 0 which might also point to line 1 again because the first element in current_dataset_functionBounds is 1, that would cause the first function to be processed twice. 

So the solution is to check if the first boundary is at line 1. If it is, we should skip the initial -1 iteration because the first valid function starts at line 1. The correction skips the initial -1 iteration by incrementing the counters before the loop starts when the first boundary is 1. That way, the loop starts processing from the next boundary, avoiding the duplicate processing of the first function. Adding a conditional check to skip the initial iteration when the first boundary is 1 should fix the duplication issue.

The duplicate function line occurs because the boundary detection starts at line 1 (script's shebang), and your iteration logic processes overlapping ranges. Here's how to fix it:

1. Add logic to skip the -1 iteration when first valid function starts at line 1:
```bash
# Before main loop
if [[ "${current_dataset_functionBounds[0]}" == "1" ]]
then
    (( currentIteration++ )) 
    (( currentIterationNext++ ))
    (( currentIterationNextNext++ ))
fi
```

2. This ensures initial invalid iteration (checking line 1 as "before first function") gets skipped when a valid function actually starts at line 1. The increment moves processing to the first real function boundary, preventing duplicate handling of the initial lines.

This correction aligns the iteration counter with actual function start positions while maintaining compatibility with script headers.
